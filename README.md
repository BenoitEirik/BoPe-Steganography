# BoPe Steganography
BoPe is a cross-platform steganography software (Linux, Windows & MacOS). It is intended for all audiences wishing to store digital information in an image. Currently, only BMP files are supported.
This project is basically a work done in engineering school that I want to improve. Steganography is an uncommon but powerful practice that I would like to share with the most curious.


# Programming language and libraries
- The C language and its standard library (C18 version)
- The SDL Library (GUI)
