BoPe is a cross-platform steganography software (Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android & iOS). It is intended for all audiences wishing to store digital information in an image. Currently, only BMP files are supported.
Steganography is an uncommon but powerful practice that I would like to share with the most curious.

# My goal
My goal is to make the art of steganography accessible to everyone and thus no longer be seen as a common tool for a limited audience.

# Programming language and libraries
- The C language and its standard library (C18 version)
- Qt 5.12 (GUI)
